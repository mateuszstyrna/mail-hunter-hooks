# MailHunter but on hooks

Front end: React.js
Back end: PHP

This is the app from here: https://github.com/mateuszstyrna/mail-hunter but built on hooks instead of components.

Simple webapp that will collect email addresses from given domain. You can also specify the subpath if you want to collect emails only from specific subpages. It is very simple so you can hide addresses by using image instead of @ in emails or by loading them with JavaScript. This app simply uses regex to find addresses in HTML source.
